Cloudfoundry notes: 
Often I can't do an update with
grails prod cf-update

When that happens I need to delete the app, (but don't delete the mysql DB!)

Example: 
grails cf-delete-app coach
Application 'coach' uses 'mysql-8234712' service, would you like to delete it?[y,n] N

Do not delete the mysql db!!
Do bind to the mysql instance. 

 then re-push with
grails prod cf-push

The typical error is: 
I/O error: Connection reset; nested exception is java.net.SocketException: Connection reset

Unable to use 
//import grails.buildtestdata.mixin.Build in Bootstrap because it fails on cloudfoundry
