SummitBid Coach G2



Tracks diet and exercise.
Originally grails 2.2.5 was updated in October 2025 just to get it working somewhat.
Uses Grails 2.3.11,
java openjdk version "1.8.0_462" (sdk use java 8.0.462-zulu)
Updated in October 2025 just to get it running.

This seems to be an experiment to play with Rest APIs for the controllers. Very much a scaffolded application.

# SummitBid Coach (vintage Grails)

## Quick start
1) Install SDKMAN, then:
   sdk env              # auto-picks Grails 2.3.11 + Java 8
2) Run:
   grails clean
   grails run-app

## Notes
- Dev DB: H2 in-memory, dbCreate=update (or create-drop)
- Shiro plugin 1.2.1
- Tomcat plugin 7.0.55


Uses 'FatSecret' javascript and soon to use 'FatSecret' API

Cloudfoundry notes: 
Often I can't do an update with
grails prod cf-update

When that happens I need to delete the app, (but don't delete the mysql DB!)

Example: 
grails cf-delete-app coach
Application 'coach' uses 'mysql-8234712' service, would you like to delete it?[y,n] N

Do not delete the mysql db!!
Do bind to the mysql instance. 

 then re-push with
grails prod cf-push

The typical error is: 
I/O error: Connection reset; nested exception is java.net.SocketException: Connection reset

Unable to use 
//import grails.buildtestdata.mixin.Build in Bootstrap because it fails on cloudfoundry
